Want to land more gigs? Get featured in major publications? Catch the attention of record labels and festival bookers?

An Electronic Press Kit (EPK) is your music industry resume—the key to making a strong first impression. It tells your story, highlights your music, and gives industry professionals everything they need to know to take you seriously.

But here’s the thing—not all EPKs are created equal. A weak or cluttered press kit can do more harm than good, while a polished, strategic EPK opens doors.

So, how do you create one that stands out?

That’s exactly what I’ll cover in this guide. Let’s dive in.

## What Is an EPK?

An EPK is a professional music portfolio designed for industry professionals like booking agents, journalists, and record labels. It compiles essential information about you as an artist—your bio, music, press coverage, photos, and contact details—into a single, easy-to-access format.

Industry professionals rely on EPKs to quickly assess an artist’s brand, audience, and potential fit for opportunities. Without one, you risk missing out on press features, gigs, and partnerships simply because key decision-makers couldn’t find the right information.

A well-crafted EPK isn’t just a formality—it’s a tool that helps you stand out, present yourself professionally, [get your music heard](https://oddlysimpl.xyz/get-heard/), and make it easy for industry contacts to take the next step.

## Who Is the EPK For?

Your EPK isn’t for fans—it’s for music industry professionals. While fans might come across it on your website, it’s really for:

- **Bookers and promoters**: Who can book you for shows and events.

- **Managers and labels**: To assess your career potential and marketability.

- **Publishers**: Who can get your music into ads and TV shows.

- **Journalists and bloggers**: To pull details for press articles and reviews.

At its core, your EPK is a professional pitch to help you [market your music](https://oddlysimpl.xyz/5-ways-to-market-your-music/). It delivers all the information an industry insider needs to write about you, book you, or sign you—all in one place.&nbsp;

A strong EPK makes their job easier, which increases your chances of getting noticed and securing opportunities.

## What Goes in an EPK?

Let&#8217;s break this down into exactly what you need in your EPK. Here&#8217;s my tried-and-tested formula with no fluff—just what works.

### Bio/Introduction

Your artist bio is one of the most important elements of your EPK. It’s the first thing people read when considering you for gigs, press coverage, or collaborations.&nbsp;

Over the years, I’ve seen countless bios—some that instantly grab attention and others that get ignored. The difference? Clarity, structure, and a compelling narrative.

A strong bio follows a simple format:

- **First paragraph**: Cover your genre, background, and recent projects.

- **Second paragraph**: Highlight your influences, key achievements, and future plans.

Keep it sharp, engaging, and easy to skim.&nbsp;

**Pro Tip**: Promoters and journalists will copy/paste your bio directly. So write it like you want to see it on a festival poster or music blog. If it feels awkward there, rewrite it.

The best bios strike a perfect balance—informative but not overwhelming, professional but not generic. Your bio shapes how the industry sees you before they hear your music, so take the time to craft it properly.

### Press Photos

High-quality press photos are essential—high resolution, professionally shot, and easy to download.&nbsp;

When blogs and venues need a photo of you, they can&#8217;t use blurry, poorly lit, or low-resolution snapshots. Your photos have to be high-quality to look good online and in print.

Professional photos are an investment but cheaper than losing opportunities due to low-effort images.

Before your shoot, take time to plan. What story do you want your visuals to tell? Look at how artists like Haviah Mighty use strong visuals to reinforce their brand. Your photos should do the same.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Haviah-Mighty-Press-Photos-EPK.webp?resize=800%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Haviah Mighty Press Photos EPK" class="wp-image-7732" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Haviah-Mighty-Press-Photos-EPK.webp?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Haviah-Mighty-Press-Photos-EPK.webp?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Haviah-Mighty-Press-Photos-EPK.webp?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Haviah-Mighty-Press-Photos-EPK.webp?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>

Alongside traditional press shots, include:

- Studio photos – Capturing the creative process.

- Behind-the-scenes images – Showing your personality and work ethic.

- Live performance shots – Demonstrating your stage presence.

Upload these in multiple formats—landscape, portrait, and square—so they work across different platforms. And if you’re promoting a new release, add your cover art to your EPK. It helps journalists and promoters visually connect your brand to your music.

### Best Songs

No one has time to sift through your catalog. You have about 30 seconds to catch someone&#8217;s attention and get them hyped to book you.That means showcasing your best and boldest.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Jack-Harris-EPK.webp?resize=800%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Jack Harris EPK" class="wp-image-7735" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Jack-Harris-EPK.webp?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Jack-Harris-EPK.webp?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Jack-Harris-EPK.webp?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Jack-Harris-EPK.webp?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>

Lead with four to five of your strongest songs. Not your personal favorites—the ones that are actually performing. That means:

- Your highest streaming numbers&nbsp;

- Songs that kill when you play live

- Tracks that are getting noticed

- Your latest release

Make streaming effortless. Your music should be instantly accessible—no extra clicks, no digging through pages. Most EPK platforms have built-in players, and if you&#8217;re using a custom site, you can embed Spotify, SoundCloud, or Bandcamp links to keep everything in one place.

Beyond streaming, consider offering downloadable files. Radio DJs, bookers, and bloggers often need MP3 or WAV files for airplay or editorial use. If they have to ask you for the files they need, you might not get featured.

The easier it is to hear your music, the more opportunities you’ll create.

### Videos

Videos take your EPK from static to dynamic, giving industry professionals a real sense of your artistry. The two most important types to include are:

- **Live performance footage**: Bookers need to see your stage presence in action. A strong live video proves you can engage a crowd and deliver a solid performance.

- **Professional music videos**: A polished [music video promotion](https://oddlysimpl.xyz/music-video-promotion/) will do wonders. It reinforces your image and artistry, showing you’re serious about your career.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wolf-Moon-videos-in-EPK.webp?resize=800%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Wolf &amp; Moon videos in EPK" class="wp-image-7741" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wolf-Moon-videos-in-EPK.webp?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wolf-Moon-videos-in-EPK.webp?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wolf-Moon-videos-in-EPK.webp?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wolf-Moon-videos-in-EPK.webp?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>

If you don’t have high-quality footage, prioritize creating it—especially if you’re focused on landing live shows. Bookers want proof that you can command a stage and sound great live.

**Pro Tip:** No live footage yet? A lyric video or behind-the-scenes clip can still add value to your EPK. Even a simple, well-edited video helps showcase your music and personality.

Just make sure to embed your videos directly instead of linking out. The goal is to keep everything accessible—no extra clicks required.

As with your music selection, curation matters. Stick to two or three of your strongest videos—your best live performance and most recent music video make a solid combination.

### Press Coverage

When there’s buzz around your name, industry pros take you more seriously. That’s where press quotes, reviews, and accolades come in—they reinforce that you’re making an impact.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Megan-Burtt-EPK.webp?resize=800%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Megan Burtt EPK" class="wp-image-7736" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Megan-Burtt-EPK.webp?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Megan-Burtt-EPK.webp?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Megan-Burtt-EPK.webp?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Megan-Burtt-EPK.webp?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>

If you’ve been featured in articles, pull standout quotes and include links to the full pieces. Beyond media coverage, highlight key milestones that add credibility, such as:

- Award nominations or wins

- Streaming milestones (**Pro Tip:** Learn what [analytics](https://oddlysimpl.xyz/music-analytics/)&nbsp;the industry pros care about so you can update your EPK when you hit key milestones)

- Chart placements

- Radio airplay

- Festival lineups

These details show momentum and make you more attractive to labels, promoters, and journalists.

If you don’t have press yet, don’t wait to publish your EPK. Media coverage takes time to build, and you can update your press section as you gain traction. Start with what you have and grow from there.

### Social Media Links

Your EPK should make it easy for industry professionals to find and follow you on social media and streaming platforms. These links give journalists, managers, and labels a direct look at your fanbase, engagement, and overall presence.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Jack-Harris-About-info.webp?resize=800%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Jack Harris About info" class="wp-image-7733" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Jack-Harris-About-info.webp?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Jack-Harris-About-info.webp?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Jack-Harris-About-info.webp?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Jack-Harris-About-info.webp?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>

Different industry professionals look for different things:

- Journalists and bloggers often link to an artist’s Instagram or Facebook in articles.

- Labels and managers check Apple Music and [Spotify playlists](https://oddlysimpl.xyz/spotify-playlists-101-guide/), profiles, and social media to see if your streams translate into an engaged audience.

Be strategic with what you include. Linking to an inactive or barely-followed profile does more harm than good. Instead, highlight the platforms where you’re actively promoting your music—Instagram, TikTok, or YouTube.

If you’re not consistently creating social media content, start now. A strong online presence can be the difference between getting noticed or getting overlooked.

### Tour or Event Dates

Hitting the road soon? Then, you want everyone who sees your EPK to know about it. Include a calendar of upcoming shows and tour dates—from [local shows](https://oddlysimpl.xyz/how-to-promote-a-local-show/) to clubs and theaters. This makes it easy for promoters, venues, and industry professionals to check your availability and see when you’ll be in their city.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tour-dates-EPK-page.webp?resize=800%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Tour dates EPK page" class="wp-image-7740" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tour-dates-EPK-page.webp?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tour-dates-EPK-page.webp?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tour-dates-EPK-page.webp?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tour-dates-EPK-page.webp?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>

Each entry should include:

- Date

- City

- Venue name

- A link for more details

Beyond bookers, this section is also valuable for journalists, labels, and managers who may want to see you perform live before reaching out. If you’re actively gigging, keep this section updated—a solid tour schedule signals momentum and helps position you for bigger opportunities.

### Contact Information

Your contact details should be easy to find—industry professionals won’t waste time searching for them. Place them clearly towards the bottom of your EPK and use a dedicated artist email, not a personal one. This looks more professional and keeps important messages from getting lost in your inbox.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ben-Monkhouse-Inquiry-Form.webp?resize=800%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="Ben Monkhouse Inquiry Form" class="wp-image-7731" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ben-Monkhouse-Inquiry-Form.webp?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ben-Monkhouse-Inquiry-Form.webp?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ben-Monkhouse-Inquiry-Form.webp?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ben-Monkhouse-Inquiry-Form.webp?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>

If you have a manager, publicist, or booking agent, list their details with clear labels for different inquiries:

- For booking inquiries, contact: [Booking Agent Name &amp; Email]

- For press inquiries, contact: [Publicist Name &amp; Email]

- For general inquiries, contact: [Artist Email]

If you’d rather not share your email publicly, set up an inquiry form on your website—most EPK and website builders offer this feature.

You should also create a dedicated email address specifically for your music career. This helps separate important industry communications from personal emails and looks more professional than using your email address.

&nbsp;Make it easy for the right people to reach you, and you’ll never miss an opportunity.

### Discography

Your discography provides a snapshot of your artistic journey, giving industry professionals a clear view of your growth and achievements.&nbsp;

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="400" src="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/aaron-oshea-discography.webp?resize=800%2C400&#038;ssl=1" alt="aaron oshea discography" class="wp-image-7730" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/aaron-oshea-discography.webp?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/aaron-oshea-discography.webp?resize=300%2C150&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/aaron-oshea-discography.webp?resize=1024%2C512&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/aaron-oshea-discography.webp?resize=768%2C384&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>

List your releases from most recent to oldest, including:

- Release title

- Format (Single, EP, Album)

- Release date

- Notable achievements (e.g., press coverage, chart placements, award nominations)

To make listening seamless, embed a Spotify or Apple Music playlist featuring your full catalog. This allows journalists, promoters, and labels to easily explore your work and see how your sound has evolved.

A well-organized discography adds credibility and reinforces your consistency, growth, and impact in the industry.

## How to Make a Press Kit for a Band: 5 Steps For a Bulletproof EPK

Now that you know what goes into an EPK, it&#8217;s time to put it all together. Here&#8217;s how to create one that stands out.

### 1. Gather Your Assets

Before you start designing, make sure you have all the essential elements:

- Artist bio

- High-quality press photos

- Music samples (top songs, streaming links, downloadable files)

- Live performance videos

- Social media and website links

- Tour dates

- Press coverage (if available)

- Contact information

Having everything prepared in advance makes the process smoother and ensures nothing important gets overlooked.

### 2. Organize Your Information

A strong EPK follows a clear, logical structure. Before designing, arrange everything in a Google doc or notes app so you can refine the flow.

While there&#8217;s no single correct way to structure an EPK, most follow this format:

- **Bio**: Introduce who you are and what you do.

- **Music**: Feature your best songs with embedded players.

- **Visuals**: Include press photos and live performance videos.

- **Press Coverage**: Highlight key quotes and media mentions.

- **Tour Dates**: List upcoming shows and appearances.

- **Contact Details**: Make it easy for industry professionals to reach you.

- **Discography**: Provide an overview of past releases.

If you have strong press coverage or a charting single, consider leading with those for maximum impact. The goal is to make important information easy to find.

### 3. Design Your EPK

Your EPK should live on your website. If you don’t have one yet, this is the perfect time to set it up.&nbsp;

Your EPK should live on a dedicated page on your website—that’s the easiest way for the press and promoters to access it. If you&#8217;re using [Bandzoogle](https://bandzoogle.com/features/epk) or [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/tour/music-website), you can create a professional EPK page without coding.

For those who prefer a PDF version, you can design it in [Canva](https://www.canva.com/media-kits/templates/) or [Adobe Express](https://www.adobe.com/express/learn/blog/media-kit) and host it on Dropbox or Google Drive for easy sharing. A PDF is useful for direct emails, but always have a live web page for quick access.

Whichever format you choose, branding matters. Use fonts, colors, and layouts that match your music’s aesthetic. A cohesive, professional design makes a lasting impression.

### 4. Compile and Refine

Before making your EPK public, review it with a critical eye. Step away for a day or two, then come back and check for:

- **Spelling and grammar**: Any typos?

- **Clarity and flow**: Is everything easy to skim?

- **Professionalism**: Does it look polished and industry-ready?

- **Accuracy**: Are all links, dates, and details correct?

For an extra layer of quality control, ask industry peers or trusted friends to review it. Fresh eyes can catch things you might miss.

**Pro Tip**: Ask ChatGPT to read your bio like a promoter, label rep, or music journalist. It might give you some ideas to punch it up or point out areas for improvement.

### 5. Distribute Your EPK

Once your EPK is polished, get it in front of the right people.

- **Add it to your social media bios** (Instagram, TikTok, Facebook).

- **Include it in your email signature** so every message you send promotes your work.

- **Share it in press pitches**. Whenever you contact journalists, blogs, or booking agents, include the link to make it easy for them to learn more.

Your EPK is one of your most valuable tools—keep it updated and use it to create new opportunities.&nbsp;
