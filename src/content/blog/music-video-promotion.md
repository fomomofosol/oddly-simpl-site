But fear not, my friend, I gotchu.

You may not realize it, but your music and your video are an experience &#8211; a narrative, a story that can move, inspire, and even change the people who listen to it.

Making a music video is only half the battle.

The other half? Getting it seen.

This post is a comprehensive guide that provides valuable insights and techniques for effectively promoting your music video. This playbook offers 10 powerful strategies to help you get your video seen by a wider audience. So, if you want to take your music video to the next level and ensure its success, this guide is a must-read for you.

## What is the best way to promote a music video?

Generally speaking, the key to gaining traction while promoting your music video boils down to focusing on three main domains &#8211; distribution,&nbsp;social media, and partnerships. However the best way to promote a music video is without a doubt by using digital ads to drive traffic to your video (specifially Google Ads).

BUT &#8211; the&nbsp;*real*&nbsp;question you should be asking yourself is:

*What&#8217;s the most effective way to promote&nbsp;**my**&nbsp;music video?*

See the difference?&nbsp;

It&#8217;s all about unique and tailored strategies folks!

One-size-doesn&#8217;t-fit-all in this game, so why should you play by generic rules?&nbsp;

And with that being said, let&#8217;s kick off this joyride with ten powerhouse strategies designed to skyrocket your music video promotion strategy.

Buckle up!&nbsp;

## Put your video behind a gated platform (pre-save to unlock, follow gates etc)

You got the goods &#8211; this music video that you&#8217;re just itching to share with the world.&nbsp;

But before you make it public, there&#8217;s a genius little trick to reward your most dedicated fans.

And that, my friend, is by uploading your video as unlisted on YouTube and setting it behind a follow gate, or rather, a place where fans take a desired action in order to unlock (pre-save, sms/email submission etc)

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="756" src="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/example-of-a-follow-gate-for-music.webp?resize=800%2C756&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7417" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/example-of-a-follow-gate-for-music.webp?resize=1024%2C968&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/example-of-a-follow-gate-for-music.webp?resize=300%2C284&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/example-of-a-follow-gate-for-music.webp?resize=768%2C726&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/example-of-a-follow-gate-for-music.webp?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>

This strategy adds an irresistibly exclusive allure to your content.&nbsp;

Think about it, who wouldn&#8217;t want to be part of the &#8216;chosen few&#8217;, getting their hands on your music video before everyone else?

Now &#8211; how would they achieve this coveted status? Simple &#8211; by either following your Spotify (boosting your followers &#8211; yay!) or by sharing their email (growing your&nbsp;email list&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;double yay!). And voila, once they&#8217;ve fulfilled these prerequisites, they get to feast their eyes on your musical masterpiece.

You can use a myriad of tools such as Smart Noise (which as a URL redirect upon pre-save completion) to set this up.

This early access not only makes your fans feel extra special, but it also drives constructive conversation around your content before it even becomes public.&nbsp;

Give it a whirl &#8211; your fans, and your future self, will thank you for it.

## Get Music Blog Coverage

Round up the troops and send out a&nbsp;press release to&nbsp;[music blogs](https://oddlysimpl.xyz/5-ways-to-market-your-music/).&nbsp;

Let ’em know you&#8217;ve got a new video and it’s worth checking out. Make it easy for them &#8211; build a solid [EPK page](https://oddlysimpl.xyz/create-an-epk/) and pass it along when you reach out. 

Blogs can seem old school, but hey, if it&#8217;s worked for decades- why stop now?

You can hire a publicist to do this for you, or you can reach out to journalists yourself.

Just remember &#8211; music blogs do not equate to more streams / views.

But Anthony &#8211; this is part of your how to promote your video post &#8211; whatcha mean?

Blogs have their place in the music marketing ecosystem. They provide legitimacy to an artist, help with SEO, and give you bragging rights.

Seldom do you get new listeners because of a blog feature.

## Promote Your Music Video on Social Media

You might be thinking, &#8220;Well, duh!&#8221;

But hey, the power of&nbsp;social media can&#8217;t be overstated.

Platforms like&nbsp;**TikTok**,&nbsp;**Instagram**, and not to forget&nbsp;**YouTube Shorts**&nbsp;are perfect for sharing short, compelling snippets of your video. They say a&nbsp;picture&#8217;s worth a&nbsp;thousand words, but a&nbsp;sneak-peek video clip? That&#8217;s worth a&nbsp;million plays.&nbsp;

The trick here is piquing the curiosity of your audience.

Leading up to the release, share behind-the-scenes footage, teasers, the story/emotions behind the track, or one-liners from your song that&#8217;s going to have them clicking faster than a cat meme.

Be playful, be creative, be you &#8211; because that&#8217;s what people love to see and that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going to make your music video stand out in a sea of same-same-but-different content.&nbsp;

## Run Paid Ads to Drive More Views

Running ads on Meta&nbsp;**(Facebook/Instagram)&nbsp;**and of course&nbsp;**YouTube**&nbsp;are an insane music video promotion hack. Yes, it&#8217;ll cost you, but getting your video in front of an audience that&#8217;s already interested in your genre?&nbsp;**Priceless.&nbsp;**

For example, our client MILES tasked us with driving views to his official music video. We did this by running digital ads on Google/YouTube.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="899" src="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/output-onlinepngtools-14.png?resize=800%2C899&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-41" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/output-onlinepngtools-14.png?resize=911%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 911w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/output-onlinepngtools-14.png?resize=267%2C300&amp;ssl=1 267w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/output-onlinepngtools-14.png?resize=768%2C863&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/output-onlinepngtools-14.png?w=1160&amp;ssl=1 1160w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>

Paid ads for artists infiltrate the feeds of prospective fans, potentially getting them to become lifelong fans. You&#8217;d be surprised how much mileage you can get out of a well-placed Facebook or Instagram ad campaign.

But for promoting your music video (once it&#8217;s out), I&#8217;d recomend running ads on YouTube, since you can get even more detailed with your targeting and the views count like normal, organic views.&nbsp;

Got a punk rock music video?

Target fans of similar bands.

Got a catchy power ballad?

Find channels focused on love songs and romantic playlists.

It&#8217;s all about the right audience in the right place, at the right time.&nbsp;

But hey – I know what you&#8217;re thinking: &#8220;Isn&#8217;t this the part where I have to shell out big bucks?&#8221;

While it&#8217;s true that running paid ads isn&#8217;t free, you gotta see music promotion as a worthwhile investment, no different than the cost of recording the damn songs.

Start small, test out different types of ads, look at your results, and fine-tune your approach. The important thing here is to learn and adapt.&nbsp;

## Send An Email Campaign&nbsp;

Email and SMS marketing is still slept on in music marketing &#8211; you gotta be using them.&nbsp;

The crazy part? You probably already have an email list ready to go if you have ran a pre-save campaign before.&nbsp;

Just export those emails from your smart link provider, and bam, you good.

You can use a platform like Laylo to send emails and SMS campaigns to your fans.

A punchy, personalized email announcing your new music video can create a ripple effect. It&#8217;s all about making your followers feel special, keeping them posted, and building up anticipation. So, go ahead and weave your magic!&nbsp;

I could ramble on about this all day, but I&#8217;ll shut up now.

Just do yourself a favor and don&#8217;t ignore the power of email and SMS marketing.

Trust me, your music video will thank you.

## Host a&nbsp;YouTube Premiere&nbsp;

Utilize the &#8216;premiere&#8217; feature on YouTube to organize an event around your video&#8217;s release. Unlike just dropping your clip and waiting for the views to pile up, this feature notifies your subscribers and creates a scheduled event.&nbsp;

Now, you might ask,&nbsp;*&#8220;Isn’t this just like a regular upload, but with extra steps?&#8221;*. No way, Jose! Not only does it promote the fact that you are releasing a new video, but it also creates a live chat atmosphere.

Here you can personally engage with viewers in real-time, respond to comments, and build a sense of community around your video premiere. We call that&nbsp;**engagement**, my friend!&nbsp;

So, clear your calendar, hype up your fans, and countdown to the&nbsp;**big premiere**.

You know what we’re talking about &#8211; that sense of anticipation and the universal &#8220;can&#8217;t wait to watch&#8221;—it can do wonders!&nbsp;

Prob my favorite part of a YouTube Premiere is that it allows you to live chat with viewers during the video&#8217;s &#8216;premiere&#8217;. This brings an element of interactivity and involvement, which can drive loyalty from potential fans.

Here are some quick tips for your next YouTube music video premiere:

- **Start the hype early:**&nbsp;Announce the premiere a few days in advance.

- **Throw in some BTS:**&nbsp;Bring some behind-the-scenes flavor to the chat. This keeps fans engaged and might reveal a new side of your artistry.

- **Ask for opinions:**&nbsp;Encourage viewers to share what they think about the video. This kind of interaction is priceless.

Remember: It&#8217;s not just about content, it&#8217;s about creating an experience. So whether you&#8217;re premiering a&nbsp;cinematic storyline, a&nbsp;simple performance, or animated video—make each moment memorable!

## Host A Livestream/Q&amp;A

Hosting a livestream or a Q&amp;A session can really do wonders. It not only builds anticipation around your new release but also engages your audience with direct conversation and personal interaction – a golden ticket to fan loyalty.

And guess what?

More fans equal more views! Can&#8217;t argue with that logic, can ya?&nbsp;

## Partner Up with Influencers

Collaborating with high-powered influencers – be it TikTokers, Instagramers, or even YouTubers &#8211; can give your music video some nice exposure.

The power, my dear friend, lies in their ability to reach your&nbsp;target audience in a&nbsp;personal, relatable, and –&nbsp;let&#8217;s be real here –&nbsp;incredibly cool way.

Think about it—having an influencer share, react or even create content around your music video means big-time visibility and, potentially, a whole host of new followers.&nbsp;

Now, don&#8217;t rush off to approach the hottest influencer in town.

Start off by identifying influencers who cover the same artists and genres as your music. They&#8217;re more likely to like and cover your music, and their followers – your future fans, fingers crossed – are more likely to pay attention.

You could have them:

- create reaction videos

- use your sound on TikTok or Reels

- share your video in an authentic way.

Influencers like&nbsp;**Ari Elkins**&nbsp;or&nbsp;**Jesea Lee**&nbsp;ain&#8217;t just pretty faces. They hold sway over thousands of followers.&nbsp;

And who knows? These followers could be your next fans.&nbsp;

Get these influencers to promote your video, and you&#8217;re pretty much set.&nbsp;

## Engage Online Communities&nbsp;

Communities like&nbsp;**Discord**,&nbsp;**Reddit**, or&nbsp;**Facebook groups**&nbsp;are the stomping and breeding grounds for fans of various genres.&nbsp;

- Join these platforms

- Engagr with their members

- Don&#8217;t spam &#8211; build genuine connections

- Share your music video on your profile/bio

Engage, share, repeat &#8211; sounds like a plan, doesn&#8217;t it?&nbsp;

## Collaborate with Other Artists&nbsp;

Think of other artists as allies, not competitors. You&#8217;ve got your fan base, they&#8217;ve got theirs.

Share each other&#8217;s music videos, and voila, you&#8217;re introducing your music to a brand new, already interested audience.

It&#8217;s a total win-win!&nbsp;

You can do the same with music meme pages for relevant artists or genres as well.

Alright, there you have it &#8211; your cheat sheet to skyrocketing your music video&#8217;s reach on the digital and social landscape. But hey, it&#8217;s not about mastering all ten strategies all at once. Baby steps, remember? It&#8217;s about experimenting, learning, mixing and matching, evolving. With that mind set of, you&#8217;ll soon be navigating the choppy waters of&nbsp;[music video promotion&nbsp;](https://oddlysimpl.xyz/get-heard/)like a seasoned sailor. Ringing in the views and engagement, and making waves in your journey. (I&#8217;m great at these analogies, huh?)

But maybe you&#8217;re still feeling a little unsure navigating these seas solo, or you simply want to save time and energy for your true passion &#8211; creating music.
