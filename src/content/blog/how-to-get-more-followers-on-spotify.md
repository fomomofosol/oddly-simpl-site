They say a picture is worth a thousand words.

So here&#8217;s one for you.

Does your followers graph on Spotify have a nice, vertical line at some point?

Or is it more like this?

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="334" src="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/email.jpg?resize=800%2C334&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7546" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/email-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C428&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/email-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C125&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/email-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C321&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/email-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C641&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/email-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C855&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/email-scaled.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/email-scaled.jpg?w=2400&amp;ssl=1 2400w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>

If it&#8217;s resembling the latter, don&#8217;t worry.

I got you.

In a short 2-3 months time span we almost quadrupled&nbsp;[Silvercord](https://www.instagram.com/silvercordtx/)&#8216;s followers, and grew their listener base exponentially.

We were also able to drive enough positive traffic to their catalogue, to trigger algorithms months after we had stopped ads.

At this point, their EP was basically self-sufficient.​

But how did we do this?

## **Facebook Conversion Ad Campaigns**

Facebook is a not only a social platform, but rather also a great advertising platform that musicians can leverage to reach new and existing fans.

Within Facebook Ads Manager, we casted a wide net, and narrowed it down to the countries and artists we wanted to target.

For example, here we wanted to target the following demographics: 

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="330" src="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/email-3.jpg?resize=800%2C330&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7548" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/email-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C423&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/email-3.jpg?resize=300%2C124&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/email-3.jpg?resize=768%2C317&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/email-3.jpg?resize=1536%2C634&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/email-3.jpg?resize=2048%2C846&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/email-3.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>

Once we defined 5 target audiences, we decided then that it was time to test our target demographics up against our music and video creatives.

Across the months we tested 180+ ads across 20+ ad sets composed of various songs.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="504" src="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/email-4.jpg?resize=800%2C504&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7549" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/email-4.jpg?w=847&amp;ssl=1 847w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/email-4.jpg?resize=300%2C189&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/email-4.jpg?resize=768%2C484&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>

## What videos to use for music marketing

A main content piece such as a music video or performance video is a perfect start for your marketing efforts.

We took the entirety of their music videos, resized them into vertical videos, and ran 8-12 creatives for every ad set.

Rather than guessing what part of the song resonated with fans and led to conversions, we let the data speak for itself. We wanted fans to tell us what they liked, so that we could continue to supply it.

This brought in solid results across the board, and even solid engagement on the ads themselves.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="330" src="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/email-3-1.jpg?resize=800%2C330&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7550" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/email-3-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C423&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/email-3-1.jpg?resize=300%2C124&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/email-3-1.jpg?resize=768%2C317&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/email-3-1.jpg?resize=1536%2C634&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/email-3-1.jpg?resize=2048%2C846&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/email-3-1.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>

And (just because graphs are cool, so let&#8217;s share that again) it translated into new followers, listeners and streams on Spotify.
