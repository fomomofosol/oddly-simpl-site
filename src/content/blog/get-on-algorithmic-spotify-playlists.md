## How Do I increase My Chances of Getting on Spotify Playlists?

There’s a ton of different strategies you can experiment with to boost your Spotify plays and ultimately get placed on more playlists.

Here are the most effective and ones we’ve battle tested consistently here at the simpl. camp.

### Be active on socials

One strategy to drive more traffic to your Spotify is to create a strong online presence. You can do this simply by promoting your music on social media platforms like TikTok or Instagram. 

### Collabs and features 

Collaborating with other artists can also be beneficial. By featuring on each other&#8217;s songs or participating in collaborations, artists can tap into each other&#8217;s fan bases and expand their reach. This cross-promotion can catch the algorithm&#8217;s attention and increase the chances of getting featured on algorithmic playlists.

### Follow gates, contests / fan engagement

Another effective method is to encourage fans to save songs and add them to their personal playlists. The more saves and playlist adds an artist&#8217;s songs receive, the more likely they are to be recognized by Spotify&#8217;s algorithm and included in algorithmic playlists.

You can use the various follow gates that smart link services like toneden or feature fm have available to accomplish this.

### Run paid ads

Paid advertising has proven to be the most consistent way to convince the Spotify gods in adding you to Discover Weekly or Radio. 

However this only works if you’re sending relevant traffic to your Spotify. 

You can run these ads yourself or you can leverage our [music promotion services](http://oddlysimpl.xyz/services)[ ](https://oddlysimpl.xyz/services/)to have us run them for you. 

## Spotify Discovery Mode: Explained

Spotify has recently introduced a new feature called Discovery Mode. 

Discovery Mode allows artists to boost their visibility and reach by promoting their music to relevant listeners. This feature enables artists to connect directly with fans who are likely to enjoy their music, helping them grow their fanbase and increase their streams. 

The only catch? You get paid less. Spotify takes a 30% commission but only on the streams that they generate during your campaign.

Artists can choose specific songs or albums they want to promote through Discovery Mode. Spotify&#8217;s algorithm then identifies listeners who are likely to enjoy the promoted music and delivers the songs to their personalized playlists and radio/

By utilizing Discovery Mode, artists can reach new listeners who are already interested in their genre or style of music. This targeted approach increases the chances of gaining loyal fans and getting featured on more algorithmic playlists in the future.
