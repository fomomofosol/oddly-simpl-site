Spotify recently made major changes to the algorithm that determines an artist&#8217;s &#8220;Fans Also Like&#8221; section. 

For many artists, especially smaller independent artists, these changes have resulted in their &#8220;Fans Also Like&#8221; section displaying artists that are completely unrelated or a poor match, genre-wise.

In my previous Billboard-charting rock band, Dwellings, the FAL section was one of our earliest indicators of success and eventually landing on Spotify&#8217;s algorithmic playlists (same with our agency clients).

However, recent changes to Spotify&#8217;s algorithm seem to have disrupted the FAL section for many artists, replacing the recommended artists with unrelated ones, often very small artists with little crossover appeal.

Don&#8217;t know how to read or rather watch a video?

## **The Importance of FAL Sections**

For emerging artists, the FAL section is crucial for discovery. 

When listeners finish streaming an artist they enjoy, the FAL section shows them other artists with a similar sound and style, increasing the chances of the listener checking them out. As listeners discover and follow more artists through the FAL section, those artists gain more streams and followers, helping to fuel their growth.

For established artists with a dedicated following, the FAL section helps strengthen the connection between similar artists and provides value to long-time listeners always looking for new music. When functioning properly, the FAL section creates a feedback loop between artists and listeners that benefits everyone involved. For this reason, the recent issues with Spotify&#8217;s FAL algorithm have been frustrating and concerning for artists who relied on the feature.

## **What&#8217;s Changed?**

Artists first began reporting issues with their FAL sections near the end of September 2023. 

As Reddit user [u/skate54345](https://www.reddit.com/user/skate54345/) described, 

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
&#8220;My band used to have a &#8216;fans also like&#8217; section that was a great representation of artists which sound similar to us. As of today, every single artist has changed, and it now relates us to almost exclusively bands within the same city. All of them also have less listeners and much less of a correlation in terms of sound.&#8221;

</blockquote>

The issues seem to have impacted artists of all sizes, from independent artists to major label acts.

However, some niche genres like &#8220;swancore&#8221; seemed largely unaffected.

Even artists with over 50k monthly listeners found their FAL sections replaced with artists that make no sense at all.

Frustrated artists reported speaking with Spotify representatives, who claimed the issues were the result of recent changes to the FAL algorithm and would be resolved by the end of September. 

However, as user urbanmolerat pointed out, &#8220;label artist seem to all have been untouched though,&#8221; raising questions about why the issues seem isolated to independent and mid-level artists.

## **What&#8217;s Frustrating Artists?**

The issues with Spotify&#8217;s FAL algorithm seem to stem from good intentions gone awry. 

Spotify likely aimed to provide more exposure for smaller, independent, and local artists by including them in the FAL sections of more established artists. However, replacing most or all of an established artist&#8217;s FAL section with largely unrelated artists ultimately helps no one. Listeners are left with irrelevant recommendations, smaller artists gain little benefit from the exposure, and established artists find an important discovery tool rendered useless.

As user SmokePrize said:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
&#8220;I make rap music In australia so it was always filled with similar artist from here. One day I wake up and there all these low listened rappers from America, I legit thought I was hacked or something wasn&#8217;t right.&#8221; 

</blockquote>

Having their FAL section abruptly switch from similar Australian hip hop artists to largely unknown American rappers left SmokePrize confused and concerned, even worrying their account had been compromised. 

Experiences like this highlight why maintaining some continuity and relevancy in the FAL sections matters.

Some artists have found their FAL sections replaced entirely with other artists on the same label, or with whom they have recently collaborated or toured. 

Brian Chiappinelli on Facebook said:

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
&#8220;My new related artists are way more relevant I.e. same label, co releases, etc Listener base for related artists is larger now as well Before it seemed kinda random aside from a couple.&#8221; 

</blockquote>

While sharing labelmates or recent collaborators makes some sense, for artists with an established sound and fanbase, replacing their entire FAL section in this way risks losing the relevancy and usefulness the feature once provided.

## What is Spotify doing about the new update?

As frustration mounts, many artists are left waiting to see whether and how Spotify addresses the problems. 

While tweaking algorithms to benefit smaller or local artists is admirable, Spotify would do well to find a solution that does not come at the cost of disrupting an important discovery tool for the artists that have helped build their platform. 

Artists have little choice but to remain at the mercy of changes to Spotify&#8217;s algorithms, but finding a solution that maintains a balance of relevancy and exposure for artists of all sizes may help prevent future issues like the fans also like nightmare of September 2023.

The FAL nightmare highlights how dependent artists have become on algorithms and platforms over which they have little control or input. 

When the algorithms change, artists are left scrambling to adapt. Finding a solution that provides useful recommendations for listeners while maintaining a balance of relevancy and exposure across artists of all genres, sizes, and types may help Spotify prevent future disruptions. 

The coming months will reveal whether Spotify can resolve the issues with their FAL algorithm and rebuild trust in the feature that was once an invaluable discovery mechanism for new music.

## What should artists do now?

### Be patient but vocal. 

Continue promoting your profile and music as usual, but also report any ongoing issues with your FAL section to Spotify. Explain how the changes are impacting your ability to gain new listeners. Putting pressure on Spotify, especially as a group, may motivate them to address the issues faster.

[You can contact Spotify here, and let ‘em know what’s up.](https://support.spotify.com/us/artists/contact-spotify-anonymous/)

### Analyze your data. 

Review your Spotify for Artists data to see where your listeners are coming from and what is working. Look for any changes or drop-offs that correspond with the changes in your FAL section. The insights may help determine better strategies for connecting with listeners. Just please, again, don&#8217;t freak out over your FAL right now. be. patient.

Manager Eric Nielsen also noted that if you [subscribe to an analytics tool](https://oddlysimpl.xyz/music-analytics/) like Viberate or Chartmetric, you can see your original fans also like before the change.

This is as of September 30th, 2023 and can change, so maybe check asap and screenshot / download your data to compare!

### Run marketing campaigns. 

If your FAL section is whack AF, driving new and relevant listeners can potentially remedy the damage. Run ad campaigns on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok to promote your new releases and drive streams. We can set these up for you via [our services](https://oddlysimpl.xyz/services), or you can learn how to set them up yourself via our self-paced [music marketing courses.](https://oddlysimpl.xyz/academy)

Here&#8217;s hoping this marks the last of Spotify&#8217;s &#8220;updates&#8221; that end up frustrating artists and listeners alike.

(At least for 2023)
