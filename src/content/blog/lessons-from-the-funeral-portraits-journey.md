Breaking into the music industry can feel like navigating a maze, with countless dead ends and only a few clear paths forward. The journey of The Funeral Portrait, a band that has transitioned from playing small gigs to embarking on arena tours, offers valuable lessons for musicians and their teams. From creative songwriting approaches to managing growth, their story is a masterclass in persistence, collaboration, and adaptation. Here are some key takeaways inspired by their experiences.

## **1. Embrace Creative Constraints**

When the pandemic shut down live music, The Funeral Portrait didn’t let the situation stifle their creativity. Instead, they adapted by writing songs remotely. Their single &#8220;Suffocate City&#8221; was born out of Zoom sessions, with each band member contributing from their respective studios. This setup not only overcame logistical barriers but also added a unique depth to the song, as it reflected the isolation many were experiencing at the time. It’s a testament to how determination can push creative boundaries, even in challenging times.

**Takeaway: **Constraints can spark innovation. If circumstances limit your resources, use them as an opportunity to explore new creative methods. For example, remote collaboration tools can open up partnerships that might not otherwise happen. Make the most of your situation by focusing on what’s possible rather than what’s out of reach.

## **2. Redefine Yourself as You Grow**

The band considers their upcoming record to be their debut, even though they released an album in 2016. Why? Because the band members—and their music—have evolved significantly since then. Post-COVID, they found their authentic voice, a shift they attribute to years of introspection and development. For them, this evolution wasn’t just about crafting new songs but also about reestablishing who they are as artists.

**Takeaway:** Don’t be afraid to redefine yourself as you grow. Artists evolve, and so should their branding and output. If your music no longer reflects who you are, lean into that transformation and communicate it authentically to your audience. Embrace your growth and trust that your audience will grow with you.

## **3. Leverage Community and Collaborations**

Collaborations with well-known artists like Bert McCracken of The Used and Spencer Charnas of Ice Nine Kills have added new dimensions to The Funeral Portrait’s music. These partnerships bridge generations of emo, blending &#8220;elder emo&#8221; influences with modern emo aesthetics. For the band, these collaborations felt like a symbolic &#8220;torch passing,&#8221; connecting them to the larger emo community and introducing their sound to broader audiences.

**Takeaway: **Collaborations aren’t just about clout; they’re opportunities to learn and grow. Seek partnerships with artists whose work complements yours and who can help introduce you to new audiences. A well-chosen collaboration can amplify your message and create lasting connections within your musical community.

## **4. Turn Personal Experiences into Relatable Art**

Songwriting for The Funeral Portrait often begins with frontman Lee’s notes app, filled with raw emotions, observations, and ideas. &#8220;Suffocate City,&#8221; for example, emerged from feelings of being stuck—in a relationship, in the band’s trajectory, and in life. By channeling these emotions into music, the band created songs that resonate deeply with fans. Their authenticity allows listeners to connect with their work on a personal level.

**Takeaway: **Authenticity matters. Write from your experiences, but aim to universalize them so listeners can see their own lives in your lyrics. This emotional connection builds loyalty and engagement. Music that reflects genuine emotions is timeless and fosters a deeper bond with fans.

## **5. Prepare for Growth—It Can Be Overwhelming**

After nearly a decade of grinding, The Funeral Portrait is finally experiencing significant momentum. With their growing popularity has come a deluge of messages, fan interactions, and logistical demands. Managing this shift has required adaptability and teamwork. They’ve had to learn how to balance staying connected with fans while navigating their expanding responsibilities.

**Takeaway: **Growth doesn’t just happen on stage; it’s also about managing behind-the-scenes operations. As you scale, invest in tools, processes, and team members to help you handle increased demand. Growth can feel chaotic, but with the right systems in place, you can focus on your art while meeting your fans’ expectations.

## **6. Celebrate the Journey—Even the Challenges**

The band’s transition from sleeping in their Sprinter van—a vehicle with a history of breakdowns—to playing arenas is a testament to perseverance. While those early days were tough, they’re now part of the band’s lore, a story they can proudly share as a marker of how far they’ve come. These moments of struggle add authenticity to their journey and make their successes even more meaningful.

**Takeaway:** Every artist starts somewhere. The struggles and sacrifices you make along the way become part of your unique story, so embrace them. They’ll make your success all the sweeter. Use these experiences to inspire others who may be starting their own journeys.

## **7. Think Globally**

With a new European agent on board, The Funeral Portrait is expanding their reach beyond the U.S. They’re planning festival appearances and international tours, recognizing the importance of connecting with audiences worldwide. This global perspective is a significant milestone for the band as they aim to bring their theatrical shows to new markets.

**Takeaway: **Don’t limit your ambitions to your local or national scene. Think globally, and explore opportunities to share your music with diverse audiences. Partner with international agents, learn about different markets, and plan strategically to make an impact abroad. The world is full of potential fans waiting to discover your music.

## **8. Create Immersive Live Experiences**

Known for their theatrical performances, The Funeral Portrait views their live shows as an extension of their music. The band’s commitment to creating &#8220;larger-than-life&#8221; experiences has been a significant factor in their growing popularity. These immersive performances not only entertain but also create lasting memories for fans.

**Takeaway: **A great live performance can turn casual listeners into die-hard fans. Invest in creating memorable shows that amplify your music and connect emotionally with your audience. Consider how your stage presence, visuals, and audience interaction can leave a lasting impression.

The Funeral Portrait’s journey from local gigs to arena tours is a blueprint for artists striving to make their mark.
