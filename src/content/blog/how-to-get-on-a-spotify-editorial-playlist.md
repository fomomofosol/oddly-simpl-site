How do I get on a Spotify editorial playlist?

The million dollar question that we all wish we had an answer for.

Buckle up: there is no easy solution.

Like always, though, through various campaigns we&#8217;ve run, we have noticed and established some trends.

Certain bands and artists we&#8217;ve worked with through the years have landed on an editorial with a solid 50%-100% rate.

And some, who never had an editorial, eventually landed one while (or after) we worked with them.

The trends we&#8217;ve noticed?

**1) A good pitch.**

**2) Positive Spotify growth.**

Let&#8217;s break both down, shall we?

## **What&#8217;s a Good Spotify Editorial Pitch?**

Well, that&#8217;s somewhat subjective.

But we usually recommend to add certain specifics that can help you highlight why your song and you, as an artist, stand out.

Why are you supposed to be playlisted over someone else?

This is where you get to brag.

Tell them how your listeners, followers, or retention has grown.

Tell them if you&#8217;ve been on the radio, or have charted on major countries and platforms.

Tell them why your song is special &#8211; but keep it brief &#8211; this is usually not the focal point.

## **What Does Spotify Look for to Playlist You?**

Well, the above, pretty much.

A steady increase in listeners, streams and followers, for example.

A high retention rate &#8211; people streaming your music multiple times. Or a good save rate.

Anything that showcases there is growth, and there is demand.

And, you can supplement said Spotify growth with ads (you knew I&#8217;d say that, huh?)

Let&#8217;s look at&nbsp;[Darknet](https://www.instagram.com/wearedarknet/?hl=en), for example.

We leveraged their last single to help them make the most of their newest one.

We set their ads up to target previously scoped-out audiences, so we knew what results to expect.

And, we drove traffic straight to their track via a smart link to get streams and algorithms triggered.

This track had zero editorial support &#8211; the streams mostly came from current fans, recently acquired fans and, eventually algorithms.

Fast forward to January, and an additional 8,000 listeners later, and here we are again with their new single.

It made an appearance on the [All New Metal editorial.](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX5J7FIl4q56G)

Because of the positive traffic, the growth we were able to showcase, and the demand it generated, Spotify gave us a push too.

Now, I don&#8217;t suggest people aim only for editorials.

And I don&#8217;t think landing an editorial is a marketing strategy.

But I do think they&#8217;re the cherry on top &#8211; for validation, and because they do put you in front of thousands of people who may never have known about you otherwise.

But&nbsp;**they are not the driving force behind your success**.

Pair them with a [good marketing strategy](https://oddlysimpl.xyz/music-marketing-strategies/), however, and they can help you get a step closer to your goals.
