In 2018, We Came as Romans sat down with Loudwire at Rock on the Range for a candid conversation about their journey, challenges, and strategies as a band. It was a reflective and celebratory moment, offering rare insight into their approach to music and the industry. This interview was particularly poignant as it became one of the final interviews with their beloved vocalist Kyle Pavone, who tragically passed away later that year.

Through their words, artists and their teams can find inspiration to navigate the complexities of a music career. From overcoming technical hurdles to connecting with fans on a deeper level, the lessons from this conversation remain timeless for anyone aiming to thrive in the industry.

## **1. Embrace Resilience in the Face of Challenges**

Live performances often come with unpredictable complications, and how a band responds can define their legacy. At the Northern Invasion festival, We Came as Romans faced significant technical difficulties—a brownout that temporarily fried their $10,000 mixing board, forcing them to perform without in-ear monitors. Despite the setback, the band powered through their set, making it a memorable experience for fans.

“We just had to roll with the punches,” the band reflected. “It’s rock and roll. Things go wrong more often than they go right.”

**Takeaway: **Challenges in live shows are inevitable, but your response can make or break the moment. Equip yourself and your team with the skills to troubleshoot under pressure, and embrace the unpredictability of live music as part of its charm.

## **2. Strategic Touring: Work Smarter, Not Harder**

Touring is a crucial part of building momentum, but it must be approached strategically. We Came as Romans shared how they avoided unnecessary travel expenses by scheduling a short tour between festival dates instead of flying back and forth. This decision not only saved money but also kept their energy and performance levels high.

**Takeaway: **When planning tours, consider how to maximize impact while minimizing unnecessary strain. A well-structured schedule ensures that you maintain consistency and enthusiasm, both for yourself and your fans.

## **3. Let New Music Shine**

Promoting new material can be challenging for bands with an established discography, as audiences often gravitate toward older hits. However, We Came as Romans noted an exceptional reception to their album *Cold Like War*.

During a show in Pittsburgh, the band opened with their new track “Vultures.” When vocalist Kyle Pavone held the mic out to the audience, they sang so loudly that he lost track of his timing.

“It was breathtaking,” the band shared. “We’ve never had a record get received so well, so quickly.”

In Europe, the enthusiasm for their new material was so strong that they abandoned older tracks altogether, performing only songs from the latest album.

**Takeaway:** Trust in your new material and give it the spotlight. If it resonates with fans, it can redefine your identity and take your career to new heights.

## **4. Connect with Fans Authentically**

One of the most memorable moments for any artist is hearing their fans sing back lyrics during a live performance. For We Came as Romans, the emotional resonance of these moments reinforced their dedication to connecting deeply with their audience.

“We just came back from Europe,” they shared, “and hearing fans there sing the new songs so loudly felt like we were playing in a stadium.”

**Takeaway:** Fans value authenticity and emotional connection. Share your journey through your music and interactions, creating moments that are as meaningful for your audience as they are for you.

## **5. Evolve as an Artist**

In discussing their influences, the band reflected on how their inspirations have shifted over time. Early in their career, they looked up to bands like Thrice and Story of the Year. As their tastes evolved, so did their influences, with nods to artists like Lana Del Rey and Kendrick Lamar.

**Takeaway: **Embrace change as part of your artistic evolution. Allow your influences to grow and inspire you in new directions, keeping your sound fresh while staying true to your roots.

## **6. Invest in Quality Over Quantity**

We Came as Romans took over a year off from touring to focus solely on writing *Cold Like War*. This deliberate approach allowed them to craft an album they were proud of, and the time investment paid off with overwhelming fan response.

“It was important for us to take that time and make the best record possible,” they emphasized.

**Takeaway:** Prioritize the quality of your work. Taking the time to create something exceptional will resonate more deeply with fans and have a lasting impact.

## **7. Collaborate and Build Relationships**

**Takeaway:** Forge meaningful connections within the industry. Touring with bands that align with your values and style can amplify your success and create lasting memories.

## **8. Handle Growth with Grace**

Rapid success can be as overwhelming as it is exciting. As their fanbase grew, We Came as Romans adapted by refining their systems and leaning on their team to navigate the increased demand for performances and interactions.

**Takeaway:** Growth requires preparation and adaptability. Build a strong team, invest in management tools, and stay organized to ensure you’re ready for the opportunities that come with success.

## **9. Innovate Without Alienating Your Audience**

Blending the familiar with the new is a delicate balance, but it’s one that We Came as Romans mastered with *Cold Like War*. Their willingness to experiment while staying true to their core sound allowed them to expand their fanbase without losing their identity.

**Takeaway: **Evolution is essential, but so is maintaining the trust of your audience. Communicate your creative shifts openly and involve fans in the process to keep them engaged.
