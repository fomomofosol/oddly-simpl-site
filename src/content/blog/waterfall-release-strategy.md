There&#8217;s one hack that the smartest major labels and indie artists alike are implementing, and I&#8217;m here to share it with you today. I even did this strategy for years with my Billboard charting band, Dwellings.

Introducing: the waterfall release strategy.

I’ve found that waterfalling singles is one of the most effective ways to build momentum for a new project while also increasing your chances of landing coveted editorial playlist spots.

In this post, I’ll break down exactly what a waterfall release strategy is, the major benefits of using one, how to plan and execute an effective strategy, and provide real examples of how artists like Good Terms and Lil Yachty have used it to drive major success. If you want to make a splash with your next release, keep reading.

## What is a waterfall release strategy?

A waterfall release strategy is releasing a series of singles over a period of time to build hype and boost streams ahead of dropping an EP or album. Rather than putting out all of your tracks at once in a traditional album release, you stagger the release of each song to create a “waterfall” effect. 

With this approach, you release one single, then another single with the first track also included, then another with the first two tracks, and so on until your full project is out. 

Each new release boosts streams of the previous tracks, and gives you more opportunities to pitch songs to Spotify&#8217;s editorial playlists. 

For example, Good Terms first released their single &#8220;Drive-In.&#8221;

Then they put out &#8220;Old Friend&#8221;, and added &#8220;Drive-In&#8221; to the release, exposing it to new listeners and gaining extra traction.

And so on and so forth until they have an album!

## What are the benefits of a waterfall release strategy?

- **Build hype and momentum.** Releasing singles over time creates anticipation for the full project and gives each song more time to gain traction.

- **Boost streams.** With each new single, the previous tracks are also included, so their streams continue building. This helps all the songs gain more visibility on Spotify.

- **Increase chances of landing on editorial playlists.** You get to pitch each new single to Spotify&#8217;s editors, giving you more shots at getting playlisted vs dropping the whole album at once

- **Engage fans over a longer period.** Rather than dropping everything at once, you release bits of content to keep fans engaged for weeks or months leading up to the full release.

- **Avoid long gaps between releases.** Releasing singles on a consistent schedule ensures you always have something new coming out, which Spotify&#8217;s algorithm favors. Long periods of inactivity can hurt your visibility.

## How to do the waterfall release strategy using DistroKid (or any other distributor)

- Create a new release from your dashboard

- Track 1 of your new 2 track release will be your new song (upload as you usually do)

- For track 2 of your new 2 track release, you are going to re-use the ISRC from your previously released song; it should be available within your distributor, or you can use [ISRC Finder](https://www.isrcfinder.com/) to locate it

- Once you submit and the release populates in Spotify for Artists, use the newest song to pitch to editors for playlist consideration

- Repeat this process for each stage of the waterfall, and delete your previous releases if you prefer to keep your Spotify profile clean
