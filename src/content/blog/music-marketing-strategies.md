Back in the day, getting signed by a label was the big dream. Landing national radio play meant you might become an overnight sensation.

Today, the rules have changed. The gatekeepers are gone, and social media means any artist can build a loyal fan base from scratch.&nbsp;

This is great news, but there’s a catch: You have to put in the work.

Without actively promoting your music online, you might as well be invisible.

The artists thriving today aren’t waiting around to be discovered. They&#8217;re creating their own momentum, building engaged fan bases, and strategically growing their streams. You can, too.

At simpl., we&#8217;ve run over 500 music marketing campaigns and seen exactly what works (and what doesn’t). In this guide, we&#8217;ll walk you through nine proven music marketing strategies you can start using right now to boost your streams, build lasting fans, and finally get your music heard.

Let’s dive in.

## Why Every Artist Needs to Promote Their Music

With tens of thousands of songs hitting Spotify daily, promoting your music is essential if you want to cut through the noise and build a sustainable music career.

But here&#8217;s the thing: most artists don’t really get how effective promotion works. They toss money into random playlists, chase TikTok virality with trendy covers, or worse, they disappear from social media altogether between releases.

Trust me, I’ve been there.

A few years back, my band, Dwellings, was unsigned with a loyal but stagnant fan base. I was all artist, zero marketer, and we genuinely thought that sharing our tracks on social media was enough. Turns out, every other band was doing exactly the same thing. We blended in, and growth completely stalled.

The shift happened when we realized we needed more than organic reach. We needed strategy. We started using targeted, smart promotion tactics, and everything changed.&nbsp;

By switching gears and utilizing a few easy music promotion strategies, we were able to explode our fan base. We landed features in Alternative Press and New Fury Media, and our debut album even charted on Billboard.

Effective [music promotion](https://oddlysimpl.xyz/music-promotion-this-year/) isn’t complicated, but it has to be intentional. If you&#8217;re ready to grow your audience with some useful music marketing tips and turn casual listeners into lifelong fans, you&#8217;re in the right place.

## Music Marketing Strategies That Actually Work

Success in the music industry isn’t about luck or happy accidents but about having a clear marketing plan.&nbsp;

If you’re an artist who feels overwhelmed by marketing, you&#8217;re not alone.&nbsp;

Here, I&#8217;ll walk you through nine proven music marketing strategies that took my band from obscurity to the Billboard charts, and they&#8217;ll work for you, too. If you’ve ever wondered what music promotion is or felt stuck trying to grow an audience, this is your blueprint.

### Build a Brand Before Dropping Music

Great music alone won&#8217;t build a fanbase. You need artistry, a personal brand, strong visual storytelling, and a consistent online presence.

In fact, we advise clients to clearly define their sound and aesthetic before they even think about dropping their tracks. You have to know who you are before figuring out who your audience is.

Take Sabrina Carpenter, for example. Did you know she released five studio albums before achieving massive international success with Short n’ Sweet? The album didn&#8217;t just have catchy songs; it had a fully realized brand, transporting listeners to 1960s Hollywood.

<figure class="imageYellowBG wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="512" height="384" src="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2-Sabrina-Carpenter-CD-Cover-Styling.webp?resize=512%2C384&#038;ssl=1" alt="Sabrina Carpenter CD Cover Styling" class="wp-image-8020" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2-Sabrina-Carpenter-CD-Cover-Styling.webp?w=512&amp;ssl=1 512w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2-Sabrina-Carpenter-CD-Cover-Styling.webp?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></figure>

Everything Carpenter did was an homage to old Hollywood glamour, from her Brigitte Bardot-inspired hair to her live performances and even small details like her CD booklets styled as vintage newspaper clippings.

The good news is you don’t need a big-label budget to do something similar. You just need to find your unique visual identity, create a recognizable world around your music, and consistently showcase it through social media posts, album artwork, and live performances.

### Create Short-Form and Visual Content

Social media, especially short-form content on platforms like TikTok, is essential for promoting your music. But it takes more than just posting random song clips.&nbsp;

Here’s how to effectively leverage short-form content:

- **Hashtags:** Use strategic hashtags to reach the right audience. On TikTok, hashtags like “fyp” and “foryoupage” boost general visibility, but niche hashtags like “folkmusic,” “cottagecore,” or “darkacademia” help target the specific community you&#8217;re aiming to attract.

- **Timing:** Consistency is key. Post daily on TikTok (twice daily if possible) and at least three times per week on Instagram, supplemented with daily Stories. Regular posting significantly boosts your algorithmic visibility and keeps your audience engaged. It’s the core of effective social media music marketing ideas.

- **Visuals:** Your content must stand out. Move beyond simple clips or karaoke covers and create unique and visually engaging content. Share behind-the-scenes footage, reimagine songs from other genres in your own style, or tell compelling stories behind your music. Experiment creatively, and you&#8217;ll discover what resonates most with your audience.

### Plan Your Release Strategy

Once you&#8217;ve built momentum on social media and cultivated a community, strategically plan your next release.&nbsp;

Instead of dropping your entire album at once, use a [waterfall strategy](https://oddlysimpl.xyz/music-momentum-waterfall-release-strategy/). That is, release songs individually to build momentum toward the album launch. Here&#8217;s how to do it effectively:

- **Teasers and Visuals:** Start by creating engaging visual content to build anticipation. Share teasers, behind-the-scenes glimpses, and sneak peeks to generate excitement leading up to the release.

- **Consistent Content:** Continuously promote your singles using my social media. Check out my [TikTok frameworks and hooks](https://oddlysimpl.xyz/tiktok-content-template-for-musicians/) for an actionable strategy, and [Ally Salort’s profile ](https://www.tiktok.com/@allysalort?lang=en)for excellent examples of this in real life.

<figure class="imageYellowBG wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="800" height="438" src="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/3-TikTok-Ally-Salort-Post.webp?resize=800%2C438&#038;ssl=1" alt="TikTok Ally Salort Post" class="wp-image-8021" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/3-TikTok-Ally-Salort-Post.webp?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/3-TikTok-Ally-Salort-Post.webp?resize=300%2C164&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/3-TikTok-Ally-Salort-Post.webp?resize=1024%2C560&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/3-TikTok-Ally-Salort-Post.webp?resize=768%2C420&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/3-TikTok-Ally-Salort-Post.webp?resize=1536%2C840&amp;ssl=1 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>

- **Active Promotion:** Don’t just release your track and move on. On launch day, actively engage with your audience across all platforms. Respond to comments, repost fan-generated content, and participate in discussions. Your community is most enthusiastic on release day, so capitalize on that energy and make fans feel appreciated.

### Promote with Playlists 

Playlist pitching gets way more attention than it deserves. Yes, landing on a playlist can give your streams a temporary bump, but it’s not the magic music marketing strategy people think it is.&nbsp;

Playlists tend to drive passive listening, not real fan connection. Think about it: when you hear a song on a playlist like &#8220;Friday Night Dinner&#8221; or &#8220;Morning Run,&#8221; you’re probably not checking out who the artist is. You’re just letting the playlist run in the background.

That’s why playlist pitching should be a small slice of your overall strategy. It’s worth spending a few hours on, but no more than that. Focus your time on areas that actually build fan relationships, like content, community, and consistency.

That said, pitching still has a place. And when done well, it can trigger Spotify’s algorithm to start recommending your track more often. We’ve covered the [right way to pitch Spotify curators](https://oddlysimpl.xyz/contact-playlist-curators/) in detail, so if you’re going to do it, make sure you’re doing it smart.

### Collaborate with Other Artists&nbsp;

Collaboration is one of the most effective and underrated ways to grow your audience.

Just look at Gracie Abrams. She went from rising indie act to international recognition after collaborating with Taylor Swift.&nbsp;

<figure class="imageYellowBG wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="494" src="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/4-Gracie-Abrams-us.-feat-Taylor-Swift-YouTube-Music-Video.webp?resize=800%2C494&#038;ssl=1" alt="Gracie Abrams us (feat Taylor Swift) YouTube Music Video" class="wp-image-8022" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/4-Gracie-Abrams-us.-feat-Taylor-Swift-YouTube-Music-Video.webp?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/4-Gracie-Abrams-us.-feat-Taylor-Swift-YouTube-Music-Video.webp?resize=300%2C185&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/4-Gracie-Abrams-us.-feat-Taylor-Swift-YouTube-Music-Video.webp?resize=1024%2C632&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/4-Gracie-Abrams-us.-feat-Taylor-Swift-YouTube-Music-Video.webp?resize=768%2C474&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/4-Gracie-Abrams-us.-feat-Taylor-Swift-YouTube-Music-Video.webp?resize=1536%2C948&amp;ssl=1 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>

Their duet on &#8220;The Secret of Us&#8221; gave Gracie a massive boost, and joining the Eras Tour exposed her to millions of potential fans who already aligned with her vibe.

That collaboration worked because of synergy. Gracie and Taylor have different visual brands, but their sounds and audiences are complementary. You don’t need a co-sign from a megastar to apply the same approach.

Find artists in your genre on TikTok, Instagram, or even Spotify. Start by engaging with their content. When it feels natural, reach out about working together. It doesn’t matter whether that’s co-writing a song, doing a duet, or simply making a video series where you remix each other’s tracks.

It doesn’t have to be a formal release either. Social-first collabs like stitching their video with your own verse or jamming on a duet can create mutual exposure and keep your feed fresh. It’s a low-effort, high-reward way to build new connections and tap into new fan bases.

### Run Targeted Ads (Smart, Retargeted)

Meta’s advertising tools are wildly underrated in the music world. You can reach the right fans with Meta&#8217;s advanced targeting for just a few bucks.

The algorithm is scary smart. But most artists aren’t using it correctly. When set up properly, Meta’s Ads Manager gives you a massive leg up in a saturated market where 40,000 songs drop on Spotify daily.

We’ve seen it work again and again. In one campaign, we helped an artist whose sound aligned with another band called 5 Seconds of Summer. We dialed in the branding to reflect that vibe, paired it with organic content, and backed it with just $600 in paid ads.

<figure class="imageYellowBG wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="340" src="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/5-Spotify-Audience-Metrics-for-Client.webp?resize=800%2C340&#038;ssl=1" alt="Spotify Audience Metrics for Client" class="wp-image-8023" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/5-Spotify-Audience-Metrics-for-Client.webp?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/5-Spotify-Audience-Metrics-for-Client.webp?resize=300%2C128&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/5-Spotify-Audience-Metrics-for-Client.webp?resize=1024%2C435&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/5-Spotify-Audience-Metrics-for-Client.webp?resize=768%2C326&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/5-Spotify-Audience-Metrics-for-Client.webp?resize=1536%2C653&amp;ssl=1 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>

The results? A 700% increase in their Spotify audience in under two months. That’s the power of strategic, well-targeted advertising.

Want the same results? Start small. Test different creatives. Use conversion tracking, not just traffic campaigns. Retarget people who’ve already interacted with your content; they’re the most likely to become real fans.

### Create Visual Content That Extends Your Music

It doesn’t matter how often you post or how much you spend on ads—if your creative is boring, your audience will scroll right past it. Great content brings your world to life. It makes people stop, pay attention, and want to be part of what you’re building.

Here are a few ways to make your visual content hit harder:

- **Inject personality.** Go beyond the music. Use captions, text overlays, and storytelling to show who you are and what you stand for. That personal layer is what turns passive scrollers into loyal fans.

- **Share your life beyond music.** Your hobbies, routines, and behind-the-scenes moments make you more relatable. They also help fans connect with you as a person, not just an artist.

- **Repurpose your music videos.** If you’ve already shot a [music video](https://oddlysimpl.xyz/music-video-promotion/), don’t let it collect dust. Chop it into 10–15 second clips for TikTok, Reels, and Shorts. These bite-sized pieces keep your content rolling and direct traffic to the full video.

<figure class="imageYellowBG wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/6-Instagram-Post-lilnasx.webp?resize=800%2C600&#038;ssl=1" alt="Instagram Post lilnasx" class="wp-image-8024" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/6-Instagram-Post-lilnasx.webp?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/6-Instagram-Post-lilnasx.webp?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/6-Instagram-Post-lilnasx.webp?resize=1024%2C767&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/6-Instagram-Post-lilnasx.webp?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/6-Instagram-Post-lilnasx.webp?resize=1536%2C1151&amp;ssl=1 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>

When you consistently post visuals that tell a story and reflect your vibe, every post becomes part of your brand. That’s how you turn content into connection—and connection into momentum.

### Engage with Fans Consistently

If you’re regularly posting great content but not seeing growth, the problem might not be consistency; it might be connection.

You can’t just post and walk away. You need to engage with your audience in meaningful ways. Here’s what we’ve seen work:

- **Pre-save rewards.** Give fans a reason to support your next release. If you hit a pre-save goal, offer exclusive content like behind-the-scenes voice memos, signed merch, or early release. Simple, creative incentives go a long way.

<figure class="imageYellowBG wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="501" src="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/7-Opera-Fleshgod-Apocalyps-Pre-Save-Campaign.webp?resize=800%2C501&#038;ssl=1" alt="Opera Fleshgod Apocalyps Pre Save Campaign" class="wp-image-8025" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/7-Opera-Fleshgod-Apocalyps-Pre-Save-Campaign.webp?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/7-Opera-Fleshgod-Apocalyps-Pre-Save-Campaign.webp?resize=300%2C188&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/7-Opera-Fleshgod-Apocalyps-Pre-Save-Campaign.webp?resize=1024%2C641&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/7-Opera-Fleshgod-Apocalyps-Pre-Save-Campaign.webp?resize=768%2C481&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/7-Opera-Fleshgod-Apocalyps-Pre-Save-Campaign.webp?resize=1536%2C962&amp;ssl=1 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>

- **Personal thank-you messages.** Spot your top fans and show them some love. Whether it’s a DM, a short video, or a heartfelt email, make it personal. Mention something specific they did, like sharing your song or showing up to multiple livestreams. This kind of personal touch sticks with people.

- **Repost user-generated content.** If someone tags you or uses your track in a video, share it. It takes seconds, but tells your fans you’re paying attention and appreciate their support.

Fans who feel noticed stick around. And the deeper those connections run, the stronger your foundation becomes.

### Perform Live (Locally and Online)&nbsp;

Live shows used to be how artists built a following. Now? They’re more effective when you already have one.

Just look at Jensen McCrae. She blew up on TikTok with her song “Massachusetts,” and only after building a passionate online fanbase did she hit the road. Her team knew she had real fans who would actually buy tickets.

<figure class="imageYellowBG wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="649" src="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/8-Jensen-McRae-Tour-Dates.webp?resize=800%2C649&#038;ssl=1" alt="Jensen McRae Tour Dates" class="wp-image-8026" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/8-Jensen-McRae-Tour-Dates.webp?w=1254&amp;ssl=1 1254w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/8-Jensen-McRae-Tour-Dates.webp?resize=300%2C244&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/8-Jensen-McRae-Tour-Dates.webp?resize=1024%2C831&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/8-Jensen-McRae-Tour-Dates.webp?resize=768%2C623&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>

That’s the lesson. Build your digital community first. Treat platforms like YouTube, Reddit, and Facebook as your early-stage venues. Use them to test your songs, connect with listeners, and build anticipation.

Then, once you’ve got traction, take it offline. Start with local venues to build confidence and refine your set. Use your [music analytics](https://oddlysimpl.xyz/music-analytics/) to find where your listeners are, and book gigs in those cities. That way, you’re playing to crowds who already care.

Most importantly, don’t let the in-person connection die after the show. Bring it back online. Mention your social handles from the stage. Set up QR codes that link to your Spotify, email list, or Linktree. Capture those fans while the energy is high.

Because one good show can create a hundred loyal listeners—if you follow up.

### Do PR and Media Outreach

Like touring, PR works best once you’ve built some momentum. Blogs and publications are far more likely to cover you if you already have a growing fan base on social media or Spotify.

<figure class="imageYellowBG wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="569" src="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/9-Rosie-Darling-Interview-Article.webp?resize=800%2C569&#038;ssl=1" alt="Rosie Darling Interview Article" class="wp-image-8027" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/9-Rosie-Darling-Interview-Article.webp?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/9-Rosie-Darling-Interview-Article.webp?resize=300%2C213&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/9-Rosie-Darling-Interview-Article.webp?resize=1024%2C728&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/9-Rosie-Darling-Interview-Article.webp?resize=768%2C546&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/9-Rosie-Darling-Interview-Article.webp?resize=1536%2C1092&amp;ssl=1 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>

Here’s how to approach it when the time is right:

- **Find your hook.** Journalists need a reason to care. That usually means a new single, EP, album, or tour. Think about why your story is timely, fresh, or different.

- **Perfect your pitch and EPK.** Craft a short pitch that explains why your music matters and why their readers will care. Link to a clean, professional [electronic press kit (EPK)](https://oddlysimpl.xyz/create-an-epk/) with your bio, press photos, music links, and contact info. Personalize the pitch for each publication, no mass emails allowed.

- **Research your targets.** Look for outlets that have covered similar artists in your lane. Same genre, same level. Smaller indie blogs often offer better ROI than chasing the biggest names.

- **Follow up.** If you don’t hear back within a week, send a polite follow-up email. Keep it short, respectful, and grateful.

When done right, PR can amplify your visibility and introduce you to entirely new audiences. Just don’t rush it. Make sure your foundation is strong before you start reaching out.

## How to Create the Right Promotion Strategy for Your Music

Not every music promotion tactic will make sense for every artist, and that’s okay. What matters is building a strategy that fits *you*: your sound, your audience, and where you are in your journey.&nbsp;

In this section, we’ll walk you through how to create a custom plan that actually works for your goals.

### Step 1: Define Your Brand

What do you want people to feel when they hear your music or see your name?

That’s where branding comes in. Start by identifying your sound, vibe, visual identity, and message. This is the foundation of everything that follows.

For example, if you’re a bedroom pop artist, your brand might blend vulnerability with lo-fi aesthetics—think Clairo meets DIY visuals.&nbsp;

If you&#8217;re in the indie-rock lane, maybe it’s all 90s nostalgia: visuals that look like they came from a disposable camera, vintage fonts, and a gritty, analog feel.

Your brand should feel intentional and authentic. It’s not about creating a character. It’s about showing up as the most dialed-in version of yourself—visually, sonically, and emotionally.

### Step 2: Understand Your Audience

Now that you know who you are as an artist, figure out who’s actually going to love your music.

Where do your fans hang out online? What other artists do they listen to? What kind of content grabs their attention?

Your analytics will tell you. Tools like TikTok, Instagram, and Spotify let you analyze audience demographics to fine-tune your strategy.

Here’s what to look for:

- **Age range.** This helps you pick the right platforms. If your audience skews older, prioritize Facebook and YouTube. If they’re younger, go hard on TikTok, Instagram, and Discord.

- **Location.** Knowing where your listeners live is crucial, not just for future touring but also for how you communicate. If you see big fan clusters in Spain or Mexico, try creating bilingual content in Spanish and English to deepen that connection.

- **Similar artists.** Spotify shows you who else your fans are listening to. Use that for inspiration—or better yet, reach out to those artists for a collab. If their fans like your vibe, it’s an easy win.

- **Engagement data.** Every TikTok or Instagram post gives you data: views, likes, watch time, saves, and comments. Compare your top-performing posts to figure out what resonates. Then double down on it.

When you understand your audience, your marketing stops feeling random and drives real results.

### Step 3: Choose Your Platforms and Content

Once you’ve dialed in your audience, it’s time to go where they already are.

Start by signing up for the platforms that make the most sense based on your audience&#8217;s age and interests. If your fans are mostly under 25, TikTok and Instagram should be your primary focus because that’s where they spend most of their time.

Then, optimize your profile to make it easy for new listeners to become fans.

Here’s what to include:

- **Short, impactful bio.** Write a punchy one-liner that captures your essence. For example, if you’re a folk artist who writes emotional lyrics, your bio could read: “Writing songs about loud feelings for quiet moments.”

- **Links.** Use a link-in-bio tool to connect all your online profiles in one place. Include links to your Spotify, Apple Music, TikTok, Instagram, and merch if you have it.

- **Headshot.** Use the same high-quality headshot across every platform. It creates visual consistency and makes your brand instantly recognizable.

Your online presence should be clear, cohesive, and clickable. That way, when someone stumbles across your profile, they know exactly who you are and how to follow the journey.

### Step 4: Build a Consistent Schedule and Engage

Even if you don’t have a release coming up, consistency in a music marketing strategy builds momentum.

[Promoting your music on social media](https://oddlysimpl.xyz/promote-music-using-social-media/) means posting regularly and showing up for your audience, even when nothing’s happening. Think of it like planting seeds. The growth comes later.

You should post at least once daily on the platforms that matter most to your audience. While that might sound like a lot, batching your content can make it manageable.

Set aside one day a week to film all your content for the week ahead. It’s efficient, sustainable, and frees up your mental space to focus on music.

- Capture content easily in three unique settings

- Film and edit videos in batches using CapCut

- Turn one session into dozens of high-quality clips with lyrics and hooks

And don’t forget—once your content is live, stick around. Like comments. Respond to DMs. Spark conversation. The goal isn’t just to push out content. It’s to build a community that actually cares.

### Step 5: Measure Results and Adjust

Once your content is out in the world, it’s time to see how it performs.

Check the number of likes, saves, comments, and shares after a few days. Over time, you’ll start spotting trends. Maybe your face-to-camera clips outperform lyric videos. Maybe behind-the-scenes footage gets the best response.

When you find what works, double down. This is how you refine your content strategy based on what actually moves the needle.

Just look at Ally Salort. For her release “Horror Movie,” she noticed that a sped-up version of the song exploded on TikTok and Instagram. So she leaned into it, reposting, repurposing, and reusing the clip differently.&nbsp;

The sound went viral, with tons of user-generated videos using the snippet.

Your content isn’t set in stone. Keep testing, measuring, and tweaking. That’s how real growth happens.
