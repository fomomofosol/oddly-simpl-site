In this step-by-step guide, we&#8217;ll help you master Spotify pre-save campaigns, from understanding their importance to setting up your campaign, promoting it, and evaluating its success.

Whether you&#8217;re an independent artist or part of a music marketing team, this guide will provide you with the necessary knowledge and strategies to create a successful pre-save campaign on Spotify.

Let&#8217;s dive in!

## Understanding Spotify Pre-Save Campaigns

Before we delve into the nitty-gritty of setting up and promoting pre-save campaigns, let&#8217;s first define what a pre-save campaign is and why it&#8217;s important for artists.

### What is A Pre-Save Campaign?

A pre-save campaign is a music marketing tool used during the pre-release phase; it allows fans to save upcoming music releases to their music library or playlists before they are officially released.

It&#8217;s the modern day version of a &#8220;pre-order&#8221;.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="419" src="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Website-Graphics-11.png?resize=800%2C419&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-230" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Website-Graphics-11.png?resize=1024%2C536&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Website-Graphics-11.png?resize=300%2C157&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Website-Graphics-11.png?resize=768%2C402&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Website-Graphics-11.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>

Pre-save campaigns serve as a way for artists to gather necessary information, such as email addresses (or phone numbers if using Laylo), which can be used for future marketing efforts.

One of the great things about pre-save campaigns is that they are simple tasks for fans to complete.

With just a few clicks, fans can save new releases to their music library.

### The Importance of Pre-Save Campaigns for Artists

Pre-save campaigns provide artists with valuable data, such as audience demographics, an understanding of demand behind a song, or even seeing what artists their fanbase listens to.

In a highly competitive music industry, pre-save campaigns also help artists stand out and attract attention from A&amp;Rs at record labels and management companies.

Essentially, pre-saves are a great way of gauging demand for a song.

## Setting Up Your Pre-Save Campaign

Now that we&#8217;ve established the importance of pre-save campaigns, let&#8217;s dive into the step-by-step process of setting up a successful campaign on Spotify.

### Step 1: Distribute Your Song

The first thing artists need to ensure is that their music release is properly distributed.

Choosing a music distributor can be confusing, but we like to keep things simple here (pun intended).

Just use [DistroKid](http://distrokid.com/vip/AnthonyPacheco)&nbsp;*(by clicking this link you understand I may earn a small commision if you sign up at no extra cost to you).*

*Note: if you don&#8217;t know what song you are promoting yet, that&#8217;s fine, you actually don&#8217;t need to distribute your song &#8211; this is just best practice for &#8220;formal&#8221; releases.*

### Step 2: Select an Ideal Release Date

Choosing the right release date is critical for having enough time to promote your song, as well as get [access to Spotify for Artists](https://oddlysimpl.xyz/music-analytics/#Spotify_for_Artists_Overview_and_Setup) to submit your music for editorial consideration.

Planning early and allowing enough time for promoting your song will increase the chances of a successful pre-release strategy.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Blog-Featured-Images-1-1.webp?resize=800%2C450&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-7233" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Blog-Featured-Images-1-1.webp?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Blog-Featured-Images-1-1.webp?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Blog-Featured-Images-1-1.webp?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Blog-Featured-Images-1-1.webp?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Blog-Featured-Images-1-1.webp?resize=2048%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Blog-Featured-Images-1-1.webp?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>

### Step 3: Getting Your Song&#8217;s ISRC or UPC

Most smart link platforms require you to enter in your ISRC or UPC before your release, but thankfully because of the nature of the industry, specifically TikTok, you might not know what song you&#8217;ll be releasing.

And that&#8217;s okay.

However, in order for your pre-saves to kick in, you will need to have your ISRC or UPC handy before release.

You can find this in your distributor dashboard/release.

## Nitty-Gritty of Pre-Save Campaigns

Now that you&#8217;ve set up the foundation for your pre-save campaign, it&#8217;s time to dive into the nitty-gritty details of creating an effective campaign.

### Step 4: Find the Best Pre-Save Tool For You

Music distributors themselves create pre-save smart links right out of the box, such as DistroKid&#8217;s Hyperfollow links, simplifying the process for artists.

However, there is a plethora of pre-save tools out there.

[Check out our full guide on choosing the right pre-save platform for you.](https://oddlysimpl.xyz/pre-save-campaigns/)

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Blog-Featured-Images-2.png?resize=800%2C450&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-227" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Blog-Featured-Images-2.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Blog-Featured-Images-2.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Blog-Featured-Images-2.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Blog-Featured-Images-2.png?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Blog-Featured-Images-2.png?resize=2048%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Blog-Featured-Images-2.png?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>

### Step 5: Create Your Pre-Save

After you choose your smart link service for your pre-save, when creating your smart link, make sure to customize it with your artwork, track information, and release date.

This way, the platform will have all the necessary information ready to go before release.

***[Note &#8211; if you still don&#8217;t have a release date, that&#8217;s fine &#8211; platforms like Feature.fm, Smart Noise, and Linkfire allow you to create an &#8220;evergreen pre-save&#8221; where you don&#8217;t need your music distributed to start promoting it.](https://oddlysimpl.xyz/pre-save-campaigns/)***

## Promoting Your Pre-Save Campaign

With your pre-save link set up, it&#8217;s time to focus on promoting it and building hype around your upcoming release.

### Step 6: Crafting Social Media Posts for Promotion

You gotta be posting on social to get pre-saves.

There is no way around it.

Leverage [our TikTok content frameworks](https://oddlysimpl.xyz/tiktok-content-template-for-musicians/) to turn yourself into a content machine.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="450" src="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-Featured-Images.png?resize=800%2C450&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-6842" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-Featured-Images.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-Featured-Images.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-Featured-Images.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-Featured-Images.png?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-Featured-Images.png?resize=2048%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/oddlysimpl.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Blog-Featured-Images.png?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>

Perform your music in interesting settings, get your friends and family to react to your song in the car and film their reaction, use cutdowns from your music video &#8211; whatever.

But post. A LOT.

Just don&#8217;t forget to include a clear call-to-action, encouraging viewers to pre-save and share the upcoming track with friends.

### Step 7: Capture First Party Data &#8211; Building an Email and/or SMS List for Your Campaign

Pre-saves are great &#8220;lead generation&#8221; or &#8220;lead magnets&#8221; for musicians. You can motivate fans to pre-save by offering exclusive content or early access, in exchange for the pre-save.
